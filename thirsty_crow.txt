One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water.
For a long time, he could not find any.
He felt very weak, almost lost all hope.
Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree.
He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside.
Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!
The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow.
The crow thought hard for a while.
Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles.
