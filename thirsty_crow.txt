One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water.
For a long time, he could not find any.
He felt very weak, almost lost all hope.
Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree.
He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside.
Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!
